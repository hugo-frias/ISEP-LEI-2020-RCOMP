RCOMP 2019-2020 Project - Sprint 1 review
=========================================
### Sprint master: 1180730 ###
# 1. Sprint's backlog #

Task and Task description
T.1.1 - Development of a structured cabling project for building A,
and also encompassing the campus backbone.
T.1.2 - Development of a structured cabling project for building B.
T.1.3 - Development of a structured cabling project for building C.
T.1.4 - Development of a structured cabling project for building D.

# 2. Subtasks assessment #


### To all buildings: ###

- We didn't consider the amount of people using the wireless therefore for a mass amount of people the network can be slow.
- We also assumed that the doors would not cover the entire wall therefore we passed cables above the doors.
- We didn't separate the switches and patch panels for fiber and for copper. Also, the lack of knowledge might make us use too much materials.


#### T.1.1 - Building A - 1170500 -> Totally implemented with issues ####

[1] Demonstration of calculations regarding the number of network outlets for each room:

- Totally implemented with no issues: We all used the strategy recommended by the teacher((Area/10) * 2+2 ).

[2] Network outlets deployment schematic plan (including outlets for wireless access points).

- Totally implemented with no issues: All building is covered by wireless connection.

[3] Cross-connects deployment schematic plan.
- Totally implemented with issues: I think that we could had use more materials in this field because of the radius of the Horizontal Cross-Connect.

[4] Cable pathways deployment schematic plan:

- Totally implemented with issues: I think that we didn't make the correct estimations for the length and/or some problems that can happen in the real world.

[5] Hardware inventories, including: total cable lengths by cable type, appropriate type:
 patch panels, network outlets, telecommunication enclosures of suitable size:

- Totally implemented with issues: Like said before, unfortunately we may have made some mistakes in the total cable lengths by cable type field and appropriate type patch panels.
